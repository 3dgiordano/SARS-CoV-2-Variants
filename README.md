# SARS-CoV-2-Variants

This project tries to give a glimpse of the different variants of SAR-CoV-2 in the world.

Website: https://3dgiordano.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Variants/

#### Naming:

The naming system used is a mix between the names denominated by WHO, the Pango Lineage system and some Nextstrain Clade names.

The project use the denomination of:
- WHO/CDC/ECDC/PHE Variants of Concern (VOC)
- WHO/CDC/ECDC Variants of Interest (VOI)
- WHO Alerts for Further Monitoring (AFM)
- ECDC Variants Under Monitoring (VUM)
- PHE Variants Under Investigation (VUI)

If a major variant is detected, the WHO name is used.
If it is some other variant to consider not yet considered by WHO, its Pango lineage is used.
Otherwise, the first letters of the Pango lineage are used.
If the variant is in WHO/CDC/ECDC VOI, VOC, AFM or VUM, the label is included.
