#### Naming:

The naming system used is a mix between the names denominated by WHO, the Pango Lineage system and some Nextstrain Clade names.

The project use the denomination of:
- WHO/CDC/ECDC Variants of Concern (VOC)
- WHO/CDC/ECDC Variants of Interest (VOI)
- WHO Alerts for Further Monitoring (AFM)
- ECDC Variants Under Monitoring (VUM).

If a major variant is detected, the WHO name is used.
If it is some other variant to consider not yet considered by WHO, its Pango lineage is used.
Otherwise, the first letters of the Pango lineage are used.
If the variant is in WHO/CDC/ECDC VOI, VOC, AFM or VUM, the label is included.
